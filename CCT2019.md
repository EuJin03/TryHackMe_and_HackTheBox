CCT2019 - pcap1

This is a pcap-focused challenge originally created for the U.S. Navy Cyber Competition Team 2019 Assessment. Although the assessment is over, the created challenges are provided for community consumption here.

If you find the right clues, they will guide you to the next step. I did include some red herrings in this challenge, but you can stay on track by focusing on pcap-related skills.

HINT1: It's a pcap challenge. If you're doing stego or re, you're either down a rabbit hole or there's an easier way.

HINT2: It is very important to do the first step correctly. If you don't recover the first file in its entirety, you may not be able to complete steps later on in the challenge. The second pcap file has 4588 packets in it. Contact me on Discord (send a DM to username zoobah) if you are struggling with this step.

HINT3: On the final step, this was built to run in a amd64 Kali Linux environment. If you are using a different Linux distro, you may run into some problems.
